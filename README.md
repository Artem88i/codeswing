## Getting Started

1. Install this extension and then reload VS

1. Run the `CodeSwing: New Temporary Swing...` command, and select the `Basic: HTML/CSS/Javascript` template

   > Alternatively, you can run the `CodeSwing: New Swing...` command if you'd like to save your swing to disk.

1. Edit the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and see the `CodeSwing` preview window update automatically ðŸš€

From here, you can try [additional languages](#language-support), [change the swing layout](#layout), view [console output](#console-output), and include [external libraries](#external-libraries).

## Creating Swings

### Toolbar

When you open a swing, this activates the "swing toolbar", which is a collection of helpful utilities that are displayed in the editor's title bar. The following describes the available actions:

- **Run Swing** - Re-runs the HTML, JavaScript and CSS of your swing. This can be useful when wanting to reset a swing's state and/or if you've disabled the auto-run behavior for swings.
- **Open Console** - Opens the `CodeSwing` console, which allows you to view the output of any `console.log` calls that your swing makes ([details](#console-output)).
- **Change Layout** - Allows you to change the layout configuration of the swing editors ([details](#layout)).
- **Add Library** - Allows you to add an external library to your swing (e.g. React.js, Font-Awesome) ([details](#external-libraries))
- **Open Developer Tools** - Opens the Chrome Dev Tools for your swing preview, which lets you use the DOM exlporer, evaluate JavaScript expressions in the console, etc.

### Language Support

By default, new swings create an HTML, CSS and JavaScript file. However, if you're more productive using a different markup, stylesheet or scripting language, then simply rename the respective files to use the right extension, and the code will be automatically compiled for you on the fly! Specifically, CodeSwing supports the following languages:

- **SCSS/Sass** - Rename the `style.css` file to `style.scss` or `style.sass`. \*Note: While VS Code ships with language support for SCSS out-of-the-box, it doesn't ship support for Sass (the "indentended" syntax). So if you plan to author swings with that syntax, it's recommended that you install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Syler.sass-indented) along with CodeSwing.
- **Less** - Rename the `style.css` file to `style.less`
- **Markdown** - Rename the `index.html` file to `index.md`
- **Pug** - Rename the `index.html` file to `index.pug`
- **TypeScript** - Rename the `script.js` file to `script.ts` (or `script.tsx`, in order to use JSX in your code)
- **JSX** - Rename the `script.js` file to `script.jsx` in order to enable JSX to be written in "vanilla" JavaScript files. Additionally, if you add the [`react` library](#external-libraries) to your gist's `codeswing.json` file, then `*.js` files can also include JSX.

### Layout

By default, when you create a swing, it will open in a "Split Left" layout, which vertically stacks the code editors on the left, and allows the preview window to occupy the fully IDE height on the right. However, if you want to change the layout, you can run the `CodeSwing: Change Layout` command and select `Grid`, `Preview`, `Split Bottom`, `Split Right`, or `Split Top`.

![Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71560396-5152fc80-2a1e-11ea-9cff-a9590e1ea779.gif)

Additionally, if you create a swing, that looks best in a specific layout, you can set the `layout` property in the swing's `codeswing.json` file to either: `grid`, `preview`, `splitLeft`, `splitLeftTabbed`, `splitRight`, `splitRightTabbed` or `splitTop`. Then, when you or someone else opens this swing, it will be opened with the specified layout, as opposed to the user's configured default layout.

### Console Output

The swing also provides an output window in order to view any logs written via the `console.log` API. You can bring up the output window, as well as run the swing or open the Chrome Developer Tools, by clicking the respective command icon in the editor toolbar. If you'd like to always open the console when creating/opening swings, you can set the `CodeSwing: Show Console` setting to `true`.

<img width="503" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71384593-0a38b780-2597-11ea-8bba-73f784f6ec76.png" />

Additionally, if you create a swing that depends on the console, you can set the `showConsole` property in the swing's `codeswing.json` file to `true`. Then, when you or someone else opens this swing, the console will be automatically opened, regardless whether the end-user has configured it to show by default.

### External Libraries

If you need to add any external JavaScript libraries (e.g. `react`) or stylesheets (e.g. `font-awesome`) to your swing, simply click the `Add swing Library` commmand in the swing "action bar" (or run `CodeSwing: Add Library` from the command palette). This will allow you to search for a library from CDNJS or paste a custom library URL. When you select a library, it will be automatically added to your swing.

![Add Library](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71629251-4ed4dc00-2bb1-11ea-9488-78c3d71dbacd.gif)

Behind the scenes, this command update the swing's manifest file (`codeswing.json`), which you can also open/edit yourself manually if you'd prefer. Additionally, since Gist files provide an internet-accessible URL, you can use Gists as re-usable snippets for swings, and add references to them by right-clicking a gist file in the `Gists` tree, select `Copy GitHub URL`, and then adding it as a library reference to the appropriate swing.

### Readme

If you'd like to give your swing an introduction, you can create a file in the swing called `README.md` (or `README.markdown`), and by default, it's contents will be rendered above the swing code in the preview window. When a swing is opened, the `README.md` file isn't opened, which allows the swing to be focused on the core code assets (e.g. `index.html`, `script.js`), and allow the preview window to include embedded documentation.

Your swing can customize how the readme is rendered by setting the `readmeBehavior` property in your `codeswing.json` file to either `previewFooter` (which renders the content beneath the preview content), `inputComment` (which renders the content beneath an [input file](#swing-input)), or `none` (which doesn't render the contents at all).

### Modules

By default, swing's assume you're using "standard" JavaScript code (`<script type="text/javascript" />`), and allows you to add 3rd-party [libraries](#external-libraries), which are added via new `<script>` elements in the preview page. However, if you'd like to write JavaScript code using `import`/`export`, you can set the `scriptType` property to `module` in the swing's `codeswing.json` file, and then begin to `import` modules. To simplify the process of importing 3rd-party modules, we'd recommend using either [Unkpkg](https://unpkg.com) (adding the [`?module` parameter](https://unpkg.com/#query-params) to any URLs), or the [Pika CDN](https://www.pika.dev/cdn).

### Uploading Images

You can reference HTTP-based images within any of your swing files, and they'll be downloaded/rendered automatically. However, if you need to add local images to your swing, you can upload them in one of two ways:

1. Right-click the gist in the `Gists` view and select `Upload Files(s)`. This supports any file type, and therefore is the most general-purpose solution. Once the image is uploaded, you can then reference it from your swing using only its filename (e.g. `<img src="myImage.png" />`), since the swing preview understands the context of the "surrounding gist".

2. Copy/paste an image into your clipboard, open up an HTML or Pug file, right-click the editor and select `Paste Image`. This will transparently upload the image to the gist, and then insert a reference to it for you (e.g. adding an `<img />` tag). This solution works best when you want to paste a "transient" image into your swing, such as a captured screenshot, or an image that you copied from a webpage.

### Gist Links

If you'd like to add a link in your gist/readme, which references a file and/or line/column within a file in the gist, simply add a hyperlink, whose `href` value uses the `gist:` scheme (kind of like a `mailto:`), and specifies the file name you'd like to open (e.g. `gist:index.html`). Optionally, you can specify a line and column number as well (e.g. `gist:index.html@23:5`), which allows you to highlight a specific line/span of code when the end-user clicks on it.

### CodeTour

CodeSwing includes integration with [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour), which allows you to author interactive walkthroughs of a codebase. This can be helpful for annotating relevant "markers" within a swing, and encouraging users/yourself where to focus. In order to create a code tour for a swing, simply open the swing, and click the `...` menu in the editor window of any of the swing's document or the preview window. Select `Record CodeTour` and then start adding step annotations to your swing's code. Then, anytime you or someone else opens your swing, the tour will be automatically started.

> For more information on CodeTour, and how to navigate/author tours, refer to the [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour) documentation.

## Template Galleries

When you create a new swing, you'll see a list of templates, which let you create swings using a pre-defined set of files and external libraries (e.g. React.js, Vue). This makes it really easy to get started quickly, and reduce repetitive tasks/boilerplate. By default, CodeSwing includes a standard set of templates, which come from two built-in galleries: `web:languages` and `web:libraries`. If you don't intend to use one or both of these, you can disable them by clicking the gear icon when running the `New swing` (or `New Secret swing`) command, and de-selecting the galleries you don't want. Additionally, you can modify the `CodeSwing: Template Galleries` setting.

Behind the scenes, a template gallery is simply a JSON file, which is hosted somewhere (e.g. a gist, a git repo, your own web server), and defines a set of templates. A template is simply a gist, which includes the neccessary files (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.), and then defines a name and description. To see an example of how to define a template gallery, see the built-in [`web:libraries` gallery](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lostintangent/ece303a6b8c7cbf0293b850b600e3cb6/raw/gallery.json). Additionally, to see an example of a template, see the [React.js template](https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/f15a2e498523f364e36075691542af4c).

When defining the template, you can use the `codeswing.json` file to indicate not only the JavaScript and CSS libraries that the playgroud needs, but also, the [layout](#layout) it should use by default, and whether or not the console should be automatically opened (e.g. because the swing relies on writing console logs). See [the docs](#swing-metadata) for more details on this file.

### User Templates

In addition to using/creating template galleries, you can also mark your own local swings gists as being templates, by simply setting `"template": true` in the swing's `codeswing.json` file. Then, when you create a new swing, you'll see your template in the list. This option is good for defining your own templates, that you don't intend to share with others.

Additionally, if you star a gist that is marked as a swing template, that will show up in the list of templates as well. That way, you can easily share templates with others, without needing to create a template gallery.

## Tutorials

By default, a swing represents a single interactive sample. However, they can also represent multi-step tutorials/presentations, by making two simple changes:

1. Specifying a tutorial title, by setting the `tutorial` property in the swing's `codeswing.json` file

1. Defining a series of steps as gist [directories](#files-and-directories), whose name starts with the step number and includes an optional description (e.g. `1`, `1 - Discussion of text`, `#1 - Intro`). The contents of the directory match that of a standard swing (e.g. an `index.html`, `script.js` file, etc.), and it's encouraged that each step have a [readme](#readme) that includes instructions. The number of steps in the tutorial is determined by the number of directories in the gist that follow the aforementioned pattern.

When a user opens up a tutorial swing, they'll only see the contents of the current step, and the preview window will include a navigation header that allows moving forward and backwards in the tutorial. Additionally, the user's current step will be persisted so that they can take a tutorial and pick up where they left off when they re-open the tutorial. To try an example, view the [Learning MobX Tutorial](https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/c3bcd4bff4a13b2e1b3fc4a26332e2b6).

![MobX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/74594741-8d521900-4fee-11ea-97ac-1fdfac132724.gif)

### Swing Config

If you need to customize the appearance/behavior of a swing and/or each step within your tutorial, you can create a `config.json` file with your swing to indicate the swing's configuration settings. This file will be automatically loaded/parsed, and exposed to your code via the `widow.config` global variable. This makes it really easy to customize your swing, without needing to write the code to load the step config manually.

### Swing Input

If your swing needs to accept user input (e.g. to allow a user to take a challenge, play a game), then you can set the `input` property of your `codeswing.json` file to an object that includes two properties:

- `fileName` - Indicates the "file name" of the virtual input file that will be created and displayed to the end-user. Note that this is mostly valuable for two reasons: setting the context to the end-user of what input the file expects (e.g. `CSS Selector`), and triggering colorization/language support by setting a file extension.

- `prompt` - Indicates an optional prompt (e.g. `Specify the name of the CSS selector`) that is rendered to the right of the input.

As the user types into the input file, the swing will look for a global function called `checkInput`, and if present, it will call that function, passing it the current value of the input file. This function should return a `boolean` which indicates whether or not the user completed the challenge.

Once completed, a modal dialog will appear, indicating to the user that they finished the challenge, and asking if they want to continue or exit the swing. If you'd like to customize the message that appears upon completion, simply set the `input.completionMessage` property to the desired string.

> Note: If you want to provide additionally help information for your input, you can create a `README.md` file in your swing/tutorial and set the `readmeBehavior` property in your `codeswing.json` manifest to `inputComment`. This will render the contents of the readme as a inline code comment, directly beneath the input file.

### Custom Canvas

If your swing requires a custom/interactive experience, but you don't want to place that HTML/JavaScript/CSS code in the `index.html` file (because it would open up for your end-users to see it), you can define a `canvas.html` file in your swing, which will be used as the main markup content for the swing.

For example, you could create a swing with a `canvas.html` file that contains your swing's HTML content, and a `style.css` file that's intended to include user-entered CSS. Because you define the HTML via `canvas.html` instead of `index.html`, then the HTML file wouldn't automatically open up, and therefore, the user could focus entirely on the CSS.

## Swing Manifest

Whenever you create a swing, it includes a `codeswing.json` file, which defines the metadata for the swing, including it's behavior, requirements and intended presentation.

- `scripts` - An array of URLs that indicate the JavaScript libraries which should be added to the swing when run. This property can be managed via the `Add Library` command in the [swing toolbar](#toolbar), and therefore, it isn't neccesary to manually edit it. Defaults to `[]`.

- `styles` - An array of URLs that indicate the CSS libraries which should be added to the swing when run. This property can be managed via the `Add Library` command in the [swing toolbar](#toolbar), and therefore, it isn't neccesary to manually edit it. Defaults to `[]`.

- `showConsole` - Specifies whether to automatically open the [console](#console-output) when someone opens this swing. Note that this will take precendence over the user's configure console setting, and therefore, is useful when a swing relies on console output, and can ensure the swing is setup correctly without requiring the end-user to explicitly open the console.

- `layout` - Specifies the [layout](#layout) to use when someone opens this swing. Note that this will take precedence over the user's configured default layout, and therefore, is useful when a swing is optimized for a specific layout, and therefore, can ensure the end-user has the best experience by default.

- `scriptType` - Indicates the value of `<script>` element's `type` attribute, when injected into the swing preview page. Can either be `text/javascript` or `module`. Defaults to `text/javascript`.

- `template` - Indicates that this swing is intended to be used as a [template for new swings](#user-templates), and therefore, will appear in the list when creating a new swing. Defaults to `false`.

- `readmeBehavior` - Indicates how the swing's [readme](#readme) (if it has one) will be rendered to the end-user. Defaults to `previewHeader`.
-
- `tutorial` - Indicates that this swing is intended to be used as a [multi-step tutorial](#tutorials). When set, this property indicates the title of the tutorial.

- `input` - Indicates that this swing requires [user input](#swing-input), and also specifies an optional input file name, prompt message and completion message.

## Contributed Commands

- `CodeSwing: New Swing...` - Creates a new code swing, whose files are saved to a specified directory.

- `CodeSwing: New Temporary Swing...` - Creates a new in-memory code swing, which can be useful for doing quick/ad-hoc explorations.

## Extensibility

In order to allow other extensions to extend the default behavior and/or settings of CodeSwing, the following extensibility points are provided:

### Template Galleries

By default, CodeSwing ships with a set of template galleries, however, extensions can contribute new ones by adding a `codeswing.templateGalleries` contribution to their `package.json` file. This contribution is simply an array of objects with the following properties:

- `id` - A unique ID that will be used to persist the enabled/disabled state of the gallery. Note that the display name of the gallery comes from the gallery definition itself.
- `url` - A URL that points at the actual template gallery. This URL must refer to a JSON file that conforms to the [CodeSwing template gallery schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lostintangent/091c0eec1f6443b526566d1cd3a85294/raw/3c1413b49052a677b1f5d192c5c37d6b2c2b9fae/schema.json).

### Custom Languages

By default, CodeSwing ships with support for a handful of [languages](#additional-language-support) you can use in. However, extensions can introduce support for new languages by adding a `codeswing.languages` contribution to their `package.json` file. This contribution point is simply an object of objects with the following properties:

- `type` - The "type" of language that your extension is supporting. One of `markup`, `stylesheet` or `script`.
- `extensions` - An array of file extensions that your extension supports, including the leading period (e.g `.haml`).

When your extension contributes a custom language, CodeSwing expects that your extension returns an API, that includes the following members:

- `codeSwingCompile(extension: string, code: string): string` - Takes in the code and associated file extension (e.g. `.haml`) and returns the compiled version of the code. For example, if your extension contributes support for Haml, then when the end-user opens a swing using a `.haml` file, this method would be passed the raw Haml code, and the `.haml` extension, and you'd need to return the compiled HTML string.
